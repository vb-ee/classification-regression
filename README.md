# Classification and Regression Project

Project just started, for now there is nothing. Only some setup.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These are the rules for the project workflow:

- Directly pushing or committing to the **master** branch is forbidden
- Master branch has to be updated only via **pull requests** (code review)
- Rules for making changes on the project:
  1.  Create a new branch (name the branch accordingly) from the **master** branch
  2.  Make your changes
  3.  Commit changes (commit messages should be descriptive) see this website (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for examples and references
  4.  Pull changes from **master** branch to your branch and **solve the conflicts** if there are any
  5.  Push the changes to remote repository
  6.  Create **pull request**
  7.  If pull request merged then **delete** the previous branch, if not **fix the mistakes** and repeat the steps starting from 3
- Code Styling guides:
  1.  Class names has to follow **Pascal Case** convention
  2.  Variable and function names has to follow the **Snake Case** convention
  3.  Indentations has to be made only with **TAB** **NOT SPACEs**
  4.  Modules (file names) has to follow the **Snake Case** convention
  5.  Package (folder names) has to follow the **Kebab Case** convention
- Variables, functions and class names (other entities also) must have **self descriptive** names
